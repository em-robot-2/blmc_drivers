/*! \mainpage This is the documentation of the blmc_drivers package.

This package is contains the drivers for the brushless
motors developped in the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent System.
The BLMC stands for <B>B</B>rush<B>L</B>ess <B>M</B>otor
<B>C</B>ontrol.

This package provides guidelines how a device should
be implemented (see also the DeviceInterface class).
Any device has a number of inputs and outputs, see
the following diagram for an example with two inputs and outputs.

generally, we expect the following functions to be implemented:
- a set function for each input (several inputs may share a set function
which takes an index argument).
- a send_if_input_changed() function which will send the inputs to the
device if any of them have changed.
- functions to access the current inputs and outputs, as well as the
inputs which have been sent to the device. Rather than just returning
the latest elements, these function should return a time series
of these objects, such that the user can synchronize (e.g. wait for
the next element or step through them one by one such that none of them is
missed)

This package provide a very simple API in order to acquire the sensors and send
the controls to the actuators.
Example of use of this package can be seens in different demos
(PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR/demos) or in different unittests
(PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR/tests).
The demos contains the documentation inside the code. The unittests should be
simple enough to understand wihtout additionnal documentation.

\todo Manuel, can you explain how the blmc Can cards work? associated with the motor_boards? Thanks
